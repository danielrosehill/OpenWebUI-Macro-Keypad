# OpenWebUI Macro Keypad

Work In Progress / WIP.

Plan:

[Open Web UI](https://github.com/open-webui/open-webui) has some nice key keyboard shorcuts. 

You can really speed up working with AI tools / LLMs when you get good at using these. 

## Hardware

Two ideas, one of which I'm going to work on very soon, the other a down the line idea:

1) Prompt engineering macropad: Just assigning the most useful shortcuts to a USB macropad (could also work well with a Stream Deck)  

Down the line idea (this would be cool)!

Custom mechanical keyboard with macro shortcuts for prompt engineering and AI work.

## The Missing Shortcuts!

Open Web UI has a decent selection of shortcuts at the moment, but I really hope they add to it (I may see if I can work on a feature).

The ones that I would love to add (because I use voice prompting a lot):

- Start recording / mic input  
- Stop recording / mic input  
- TTS least response  

As the speech to speech function becomes more mature it would also be good to have one for toggling between that and the standard textual interface.
